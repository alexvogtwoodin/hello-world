# hello-world
My very first repository!
I am a graduate student at the University of Kansas studying Linguistics. My research interests are philosophy of language and semantics. Specifically, modal verbs, quantifiers, and propositional attitudes. I also have experience working in the Developmental Psycholinguistics Lab.
